There are realizations of Full, Stochastic, Momentum and Adam gradient descents in object-oriented programming style.
In addition, I generated function and due to that function you can see how quickly and qualitatively every type of gradient descent works. 
Actually, my code works with all space dimensions, but if you want to check for one demention, you should make all self.w = 0 in def fit, except the last.

P.S. I added R^2 for more versatility of my code.
